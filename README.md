# Quantitative Biology: Statistics and Data Analysis for Life Scientists

This repository contains all the course materials for IGP-484 (2021). You can find both the lecture slides and the code to generate all plots and statistical analyses in the designated date folder. All analyses are performed in R and require previous installation of `tidyverse`. If you don't have `tidyverse`, you can install the package with `install.packages("tidyverse")` or you can install the specific packages required for this class: `install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"))`.
