# Quantitative Biology: Statistics and Data Analysis for Life Scientists

This repository contains all the course materials for IGP-484 (2021). You can find both the lecture slides and the code to generate all plots and statistical analyses in the designated date folder. All analyses are performed in R and require previous installation of `tidyverse`. If you don't have `tidyverse`, you can install the package with `install.packages("tidyverse")` or you can install the specific packages required for this class: `install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"))`.

- [Tableau free public data sets](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets)
- [AWS data sets](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?category=ec21bae5-404b-4bac-825c-f7b0a2c713c4&FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE=DATA_EXCHANGE&filters=FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE)

## Not familiar with R? Follow these steps

1. Download R [here](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. Download the package `swirl` ([link to swirl](https://swirlstats.com/)):
```
install.packages("swirl")
```
* Begin `swirl` (interactive module to get familiar with R) by typing `swirl::swirl()` and selecting the module `1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R` when prompted.
* You can exit and later resume progress at the end of each section if you wish.

## Data analysis with the Tidyverse

Looking for help with basic data wrangling in R? New to the "Tidyverse"? Check out the [course materials](https://github.com/katiesevans/nuit_tidyverse) from my workshop for NUIT for step-by-step help and lots of examples and practice questions.

* Additionally, check out the `swirl` course `Getting and Cleaning Data` for more Tidyverse intro

## Questions?
For all questions, contact Katie at kathryn.evans@northwestern.edu (or on the biostats-484 slack)
